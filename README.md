# GridFastNavigation Add-on for Vaadin 7

Do you like the Grid but would want it to appeal more to old Excel jockeys?
Then this add-on is for you!
GridFastNavigation is a component extension for Vaadin Grid, which uses the
unbuffered editing mode and alters its keyboard controls to provide a faster
editing experience.

List of features:
- Enter key can be configured to change column instead of a row
- PgDown/PgUp support
- Tab changes column, Grid can be browsed with cursor keys.
- Typing text enables edit mode. (If you start typing with Delete key, the cell will be emptied first)
- In ComboBox / DateField cursor down will open popup
- The add-on supports TextField, PopupDateField, ComboBox and CheckBox in the edit fields of the editor.
- RowEditEvent and CellEditEvent logic
- Pressing Esc cancel edit and reset the value
- Home/End key support: Home - first row, End - last row, Shift+Home - first column on first row, Shift+End last column on last row
- Server-side focus tracking events either on per-cell or per-row basis
- Editor open/close events
- DateFields now don't stop working after using up/down arrow navigation
- Selecting text when opening editor can be enabled and disabled
- Tab navigation skips disabled columns
- Move with enter/shift+enter and tab/shift+tab as well as up/down arrow keys while editing
- Allows user to start editing without first opening the editor
- Open editor with single mouse click (configurable)
- Optional mode to close editor and dispatch edit event when clicking outside of Grid
- getItem() method in cell and row edit/focus, editor open events

Vaadin 8 branch is at https://github.com/TatuLund/GridFastNavigation/tree/vaadin8

## Online demo

## Development with Eclipse IDE

For further development of this add-on, the following tool-chain is recommended:
- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

### Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects

Note that Eclipse may give "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" errors for pom.xml. Use "Permanently mark goal resources in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build" quick-fix to mark these errors as permanently ignored in your project. Do not worry, the project still works fine. 

### Debugging server-side

If you have not already compiled the widgetset, do it now by running vaadin:install Maven target for GridFastNavigation-root project.

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your GridFastNavigation-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the GridFastNavigation-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/GridFastNavigation-demo/ to see the application.

### Debugging client-side

Debugging client side code in the GridFastNavigation-demo project:
  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" on a separate console while the application is running
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application or by adding ?superdevmode to the URL
  - You can access Java-sources and set breakpoints inside Chrome if you enable source maps from inspector settings.
